        In <i>Through the Looking-Glass</i> by Lewis Carroll, the Red Queen is a
        character who has to keep running just to stay in the same place.
        Likewise, we believe that in a world that is more rapidly changing than
        ever, companies has to constantly evolve just to keep up with its
        competition. We hold this to be as true for ourselves as for our
        customers, and we constantly strive to make the current project more
        amazing than the last one.
